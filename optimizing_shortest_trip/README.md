# Project Description
The focus of this project is, if given a list of locations, what is the shortest path possible? To find this answer an optimization model was created in Python and modeled after the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). My objective was to find the shortest driving distance between a list of given locations. I utilized the Google OR-Tools Traveling Salesperson optimization model, as well as the Google maps distance matrix API.

The Completed model is able to take a list of locations from a CSV file and will create a distance matrix of the distances between all of the locations entered. From there the model will analyze the matrix and output a list of locations in order of the shortest route, as well as the total distance in miles. The benefits of this model its ease of use, and the time if saves for those planning trips.

A poster was created to walk through the process taken for this project and was presented at the 2024 INFORMS Analytics Conference.

A video of me walking through the poster in more detail can be found [here](https://youtu.be/e8qk0L4zYrM).

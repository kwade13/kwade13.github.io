# About Me
Iâ€™m a Business Analytics Master's student with an anticipated Graduation date of 2024.  Over the past year, I have learned a plethora of techniques and technologies to better find trends, optimize processes, and predict future outcomes.  I hope in the future to use these skills to answer questions for organizations and increase efficiency.

My bachelor's degree is in Chemical Engineering and I have a background in Technical Service Engineering at a Healthcare Software company. I decided to pivot my focus to analytics because I want to dive deeper into the large datasets companies have available.  There is so much potential in the data and opportunity to answer questions for an organization.  I'd love to use the troubleshooting and problem-solving skills from my background, combined with my new analytical knowledge to work with companies to answer their business questions.

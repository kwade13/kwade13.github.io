# About Me
Iâ€™m a Business Analytics Master's student with an anticipated Graduation date of 2024.  Over the past year, I have learned a plethora of techniques and technologies to better find trends, optimize processes, and predict future outcomes.  I hope in the future to use these skills to answer questions for organizations and increase efficiency.

My bachelor's degree is in Chemical Engineering and I have a background in Technical Service Engineering at a Healthcare Software company. I decided to pivot my focus to analytics because I want to dive deeper into the large datasets companies have available.  There is so much potential in the data and opportunity to answer questions for an organization.  I'd love to use the troubleshooting and problem-solving skills from my background, combined with my new analytical knowledge to work with companies to answer their business questions.

## [Optimizing the Shortest Trip Using the Traveling Salesperson Problem](optimizing_shortest_trip)
The focus of this project is, if given a list of locations, what is the shortest path possible? To find this answer an optimization model was created in Python and modeled after the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). My objective was to find the shortest driving distance between a list of given locations. I utilized the Google OR-Tools Traveling Salesperson optimization model, as well as the Google maps distance matrix API.

The Completed model is able to take a list of locations from a CSV file and will create a distance matrix of the distances between all of the locations entered. From there the model will analyze the matrix and output a list of locations in order of the shortest route, as well as the total distance in miles. The benefits of this model its ease of use, and the time if saves for those planning trips.

A poster was created to walk through the process taken for this project and was presented at the 2024 INFORMS Analytics Conference.  A video of me walking through the poster in more detail can be found [here](https://youtu.be/e8qk0L4zYrM).
